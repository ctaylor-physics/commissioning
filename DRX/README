DRX Commissioning Scripts
=========================

gain.py
-------
JPL-created script for creating gain files to be used by DRX.

delay.py
--------
JPL-create script for created delay files to be used by DRX.

test_analog_in2.py
------------------
Script for setting up a test DRX observation with a variety of tuning, frequency, 
bandwidth, and gain settings.  Needs gain.py and delay.py to work.

checkTimetags.py
----------------
Simple script to check the time tag sequence in a DRX file and look for strange 
jumps and other badness.  It can also be used to check the DRX decimate (sample 
rate) field and if the time has been set correctly on the various boards.

drxTimeseries.py
----------------
Script for plotting time series data from a DRX file.  This file is also available 
as part of the LSL package (version >= 0.4.0) but is included here since this is 
the script we actually used at JPL for pre-acceptance testing.

drxSpectra.py
-------------
Script for reading in DRX data and created time-averaged power spectral density 
plots.  Like drxTimeseries.py, this file is also available as part of the LSL 
package (version >= 0.4.0) but is included here since this is the script we actually 
used at JPL for pre-acceptance testing.

eyeDiagram.py
-------------
Create an eye diagram for some portion of a DRX file.

eyeDiagram2.py
--------------
Look for glitches in a DRX file by fitting a quantized sine wave to the data.
