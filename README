LWA-1 Commissioning Scripts
===========================
This is a collection of scripts use for commissioning and testing at the LWA-1

checkDRSU.sh
------------
Shell script to run on Linux machines with attached and powered-on DRSU to report 
the firmware version of Seagate drives with model number "ST31000525SV".  This is 
useful for identifying disks with the newer (and less reliable) firmware version 
"CV12".
