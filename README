LWA Commissioning Scripts
=========================
This is a collection of scripts use for commissioning and testing at the LWA1 
and LWA-SV stations.  All of the scripts (everything except for TBF) depend 
on the LSL 0.6.x branch.  The TBF-related scripts depend on the LSL 1.2.x 
branch.

checkDRSU.sh
------------
Shell script to run on Linux machines with attached and powered-on DRSU to report 
the firmware version of Seagate drives with model number "ST31000525SV".  This is 
useful for identifying disks with the newer (and less reliable) firmware version 
"CV12".

time2time.py
------------
Given a date/time in the format of "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS[.SSS]" in local time, 
compute the corresponding MJD and MPM in UTC.  If no date/time is specified, the
current local date/time is used for the conversion.

mjd2local.py
------------
For a given MJD value or list of MJD values, return the range of local times 
associated with that MJD.

astroevents2.py
---------------
List the rise, transit, and set times for the brightest radio objects in the sky.

estimateData.py
---------------
Script to estimate the data volume of TBN and DRX observations.

findMyStand.py
--------------
Simple script to locate and label where stands are in the array.

plotShelterTemp.py
------------------
Short script to read in a shelter.txt file (log of shelter temperature with each
line consisting of a UNIX time stamp and a shelter temperature) and plot all of 
the available data.

Update:  This script is also now compatiable with the /data/thermometer##.txt files
created by the new SHL MCS.

plotPDUVoltages.py
------------------
Short script to plot the input PDU voltages over time from the /data/rack##.txt 
files generated by the new SHL MCS software.

plotBoardTemps.py
-----------------
Short script to read in a temp.txt file (log of DP FPGA temperatures) and plot 
all of the available data.

plotChassisTemps.py
-------------------
Script to plot colormaps of the FPGA temperatures as a function of time, chassis, 
and physical slot.
