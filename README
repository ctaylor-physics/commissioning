LWA-1 Commissioning Scripts
===========================
This is a collection of scripts use for commissioning and testing at the LWA-1 
station.  All of the scripts depend on the LSL 0.4.x branch.

checkDRSU.sh
------------
Shell script to run on Linux machines with attached and powered-on DRSU to report 
the firmware version of Seagate drives with model number "ST31000525SV".  This is 
useful for identifying disks with the newer (and less reliable) firmware version 
"CV12".

time2time.py
------------
Given a date/time in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.SSS]" in local time, 
compute the corresponding MJD and MPM in UTC.  If no date/time is specified, the
current local date/time is used for the conversion.
