Calibration and Phase-and-Sum Beamforming Scripts
=================================================

simpleFringe.py
---------------
Simple script (with hard coded integration times) for performing time series
cross-correlation of TBN data for all stands relative to the outlier (#258).

phasedBeam.py
------------
Given a reference file for calibration and a pointing azimuth and elevation 
in degrees, create a set of phase-and-sum beamforming coefficients for DRX.
