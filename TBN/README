TBN Commissioning Scripts
=========================

checkTimetags.py
----------------
Simple script for making sure that time tags update properly on the prototype DP 
system.  This script won't work for the full DP system because of how the packets 
are interleaved.

checkTimetags2.py
-----------------
Modified version of checkTimetags.py that uses the LSL TBN ring buffer to reorder
the interleaved packets.  The script not only checks time tags like its predecessor
but also checks for dropped packets and synchronization problems.

eyeDiagram.py
-------------
Create an eye diagram for some portion of a TBN file.

eyeDiagram2.py
--------------
Look for glitches in a TBN file by fitting a quantized sine wave to the data.

tbnTimeseries.py
----------------
Alpha-version script to plot out time series I/Q data from a TBN file.
