Delay Calibration Scripts
=========================

applySelfCalTBW2.py
------------------
Given a FITS IDI file generated by correlateTBW.py that contains all valid 
dipoles and both polarizations perform a phase-only self-calibration on the
long baselines using a simple point source model of the sky.

checkConsistency.py
-------------------
Given a collection of .sc files generated by applySelfCalTBW.py create a plot
of the delay for each antenna over time and combine the various files into a
master delay file called 'merged.delays'.

applyNewStretchFactors.py
-------------------------
Given an inpute SSMIF and a .sc file from applySelfCalTBW.py/the 'merged.delays' file from 
checkConsistency.py generate new stretch factors and a new SSMIF.
