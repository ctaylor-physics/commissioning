Powerline RFI Identification and Localization
=============================================
This directory contains scripts uses to locate the burst RFI seen at LWA1.

burstMovie.py
-------------
Given a TBW file with burst RFI, look for digitizer saturation events and make
a move of the power at each dipole around those events.  This is useful to see
which direction the RFI is coming from and to provide some idea about the 
variability of the RFI.  This script also makes a NPZ file that can be used with
localizeBurst.py (see below).

localizeBurst.py
----------------
Script to perform multilateration on both polarizations using the NPZ file 
generated by burstMovie.py.  This process attempts to come up with a location
for the RFI that is consistent with the observation time-of-arrival at each 
antenna.
