TBW Commissioning Scripts
=========================

checkTimetags.py
----------------
Script for checking for missing frames and bad time tags in a full DP TBW capture.  
If problems are found the error are noted and printed out.  It shouldn't be too hard
to modify this for fewer inputs.

stationMaster.py
----------------
Modified version of tbwSpectra.py that is included with LSL (version >= 0.4.0) that 
estimated the frequency (in MHz) of each dipole's resonance point and saves that 
information along with time-average spectra to a NPZ file.

stationMaster2.py
-----------------
Modified version of stationMaster.py that uses the 'ClipLevel' keyword in LSL >= 0.4.2
to blank impulsive RFI events.

smGUI.py
--------
GUI that interfaces with a NPZ file created by stationMaster.py that makes looking for
problems with dipoles/mappings/etc. a point-and-click exercise.
