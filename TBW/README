TBW Commissioning Scripts
=========================

stationMaster.py
----------------
Modified version of tbwSpectra.py that is included with LSL (version >= 0.4.0) that 
estimated the frequency (in MHz) of each dipole's resonance point and saves that 
information along with time-average spectra to a NPZ file.

smGUI.py
--------
GUI that interfaces with a NPZ file created by stationMaster.py that makes looking for
problems with dipoles/mappings/etc. a point-and-click exercise.
